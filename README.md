## ðŸ“– Story Behind This Project  

I recently learned *React, and it felt **awesome**  
To practice and get comfortable with it, I decided to build something on my own â€” and thatâ€™s how ***MyTuneTale*** was born.  

Unfortunately, ***Spotify only gives unlimited user access to approved organizations, so this website wonâ€™t work for everyone yet.*** But for now, Iâ€™ve disabled the real authentication flow and set it up so youâ€™ll always see **my Spotify data**. This way, you can still explore how it works and get the full look & feel.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  

- **HTML**  
- **Hybrid CSS approach**  
  - Traditional CSS (layout)  
  - Tailwind CSS (colors & backgrounds)  
  - Shadcn components (charts & popovers)  
- **React**  
- **Supabase** (database)  
- **Spotipy** Python library (Spotify API)  
- **Python** & **Django** (backend)  
- **PythonAnywhere** (hosting provider)

## âœ¨ Features  

- **Your top tracks & artists** in 3 timeframes â€” short term, medium term, long term  
  > (When I saw my most-listened song for the whole year, I was shocked... and maybe a little guilty ðŸ˜…)  
- **Listen directly** to your top tracks with Spotify iframes  
- **Your monthly song addition journey with a line chart** â€” from the start of your Spotify account until now  
  > (I can clearly see the months when I met that girl and my song additions spiked ðŸ“ˆ)  
- **Music calendar** â€” pick any date to see all the songs you added that day or month, in any playlist (and listen right there)

## ðŸ“š What I Learned  

- Implemented **Spotify Authorization** for new accounts  
- Connected and integrated with **Supabase** to store user data  
- Designed a backend flow:  
  1. Check if userâ€™s data exists in DB  
  2. If yes, return it  
  3. If data is older than *5 days*, return None so fresh data is fetched  
- Built a **custom React hook** to fetch multiple datasets (top tracks, top artists, playlists) in parallel  
- Implemented **IndexedDB caching** so data loads fast without hitting the backend every time  
- Solved iframe performance issues:  
  - Initially loaded all iframes at once â†’ site lagged  
  - Switched to **Shadcn pagination** (8 songs per page) â†’ site became smooth

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

This project helped me connect code with something I love deeply â€” music. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it.
